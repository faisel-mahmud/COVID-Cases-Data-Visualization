In this project, I gathered COVID data from the World Health Organization. I first organized the data in a way that I may have 3 separate dataframes to
have data from 2020, 2021, and 2022. I then produced line graphs and plotted lines of best fit, again using the ggplot function provided by R, 
so that I may visualize the data relating to the number of cases per year, the cumulative amount of cases, the amount of deaths per year, 
and the cumulative amount of deaths from COVID. To run the code, simply download the attached CSV file, and the given code, and run all.
